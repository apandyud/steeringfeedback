# Steering angle prediction from a camera image as a backup service
This repository contains a soure code of a research conducted at the University of Debrecen.

Folders:

## Subtask1: 

Semantic segmentation model training and calculation of correlation between emitted PWM value and detected angles on rear-view camera image
## Subtask2: 

A CNN model that is trained on PWM values, and that predicts emitted PWM signal from the rear-view camera image
